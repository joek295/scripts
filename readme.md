Miscellaneous scripts, mostly written in bash.

Some python and perl.

The most useful of these:
* @script - creates a file as an executable and opens it for editing in your favourite editor
* allowed - tells you if a word is a valid scrabble move. 
* anagram - takes an input word and returns English single-word anagrams.
* asciitex - takes a plaintext file and formats it as a latex file.
* dmenufm - a fuzzy file-finder using dmenu
* mpdmenu - uses dmenu to control mpd
* fran - performs a Frequency Analysis on a textfile
* mdcheck - checks whether a file has a given md5sum
* some - less, with syntax highlighting
* stats - takes a file full of data and performs some statistical analyses
* wallpaper - a script to set a random wallpaper using hsetroot

Probably of no interest to anyone other than me:
* browser - possibly the least featureful browser I have ever seen
* teatimer - a script to tell you when your tea is ready
* touchpad_toggle - toggles whether a touchpad is on or off

Scripts taken off of the internet are where possible credited.

All uncredited scripts are (probably) my own, and are free for use, re-distribution, and modification without any restrictions.
