= Introduction =

This repository contains the scripts kept in my ~/scripts/ folder,
which is part of my $PATH. They are mostly written in bash, though
there is some python and at least one perl script.

Some of these are useful little utilities for a variety of
things. Others are merely toys.

= Useful: =

In alphabetical order:

* allowed: returns whether a given string is a word in a
           wordlist. Originally written for Scrabble.

* anagram: returns all single-word anagrams in English of a string.

* cleaner: cleans up directories so that files have names in a
  standardised format.

* cloc.sh: counts the number of lines of code in a file.

* colours.sh and colors.sh: two different scripts outputting terminal
  colours. colors.sh is sh compatible, colours.sh isn't.

* fran: a frequency analysis tool.

* mdcheck: checks to see whether the md5sum of a given file matches a string.

* touchpad_toggle: toggles a laptop touchpad on and off.

* wallpaper: sets a random wallpaper from the images in a given
  directory.

== Dmenu: ==

Dmenu is one of my favourite pieces of software, and I have a number
of scripts which work with it:

* dcalc: a calculator in dmenu.

* dmenfm: a file manager for dmenu.

* dmenu_customise: dmenu + user-defined commands.

* dmenufm: a fuzzy-file finder and intelligent opener for dmenu.

* mpdmenu: a dmenu-driven interface for mpd.

* rhythmenu: controls rhythmbox from dmenu.  I no longer use
  rhythmbox, so I can't vouch for it's continuing to work.

= Toys =

* browser: an almost entirely featureless web browser.

* c960: a script to randomise chess starting positions according to
  Fischerrandom Chess rules.  Would be useful if only anyone *played*
  Fischerrandom Chess.

* leds: playing with keyboard LEDs.  Requires root.

* pipes: a terminal version of the classic Windows pipes screensaver.
