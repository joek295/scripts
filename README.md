Miscellaneous scripts, mostly written in bash
Some python and perl

The most useful of these:
* @script - creates a file as an executable and opens it for editing in your favourite editor
* asciitex - takes a plaintext file and formats it as a latex file.
* dmenufm & dmenufm_path - a fuzzy file-finder using dmenu
* mdcheck - checks if a file's md5sum matches one you give
* some - less, with syntax highlighting
* teatimer - a script to tell you when your tea is ready
* wallpaper - a script to set a random wallpaper using hsetroot

Scripts taken off of the internet are where possible credited.
All uncredited scripts are my own, and are free for use, re-distribution, and modification without any restrictions.
