Questworld plan:
Your quest: to visit the castle of evil, find the MacGuffin of Doom, and return it to your village safely.
On the way, you will fight monsters, avoid traps, and find allies - and enemies. You will also mock low 
fantasy, text-based choose your own adventures, and tropes.

Introduction: your snarky invisible guide/the narrator introduces you to QuestWorld. He tells you what equipment
you have, and you set out on your quest. On your way, you are given useful equipment and knowledge.

The Quest Begins: you must make a rather obvious choice, of whether to go straight to the castle, or to visit
the village marketplace first. At the marketplace, Anton tries to sell you a crossbow for one gold.
You then set off on the track up to the castle.

The Castle: You reach the castle, and after considering, you have a choice of walking through the front door,
or looking for another entrance. If you go to the front entrance, you ask a sentry to let you in. He tells you
that you must solve a puzzle in order to get in.
After solving the puzzle, he lets you into the main hall.
